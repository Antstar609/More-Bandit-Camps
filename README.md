This mod for *Kingdom Come: Deliverance* introduces new bandit camps across the map for players to discover and destroy. Each destroyed camp yields rewards, enhancing the gameplay experience.

- **English** 🇬🇧
- **French** 🇫🇷

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Download the latest release on GitHub or from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance/mods/1701). 📥
2. Unzip the folder and place it in the `Mods` folder of your game directory (create it if it doesn’t exist). 📂
3. Launch the game and enjoy! 🎮

## 🎯 Usage

After installing the mod, a quest will appear. Speak with the NPC, who will provide the location of the camp. After destroying the camp, return to the NPC to claim your reward. 🎯

## ⚠️ Issues

**Can’t complete the quest because there are missing enemies in the camp?**
- Just leave and come back; they will reappear.

**No marker for the quest on the map?**
- Untracking and tracking it again should fix the issue (only works from version 1.0.2).
